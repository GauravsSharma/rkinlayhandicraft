export const FAQS: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    question: "Can I order a custom marble inlay design?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Over 70% of our production consists of completely bespoke commissions. You can send us reference sketches, architect CAD files, or Pantone swatches, and we will formulate stone mockups for your approval prior to chiseling.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is the final price calculated?",
    answer:
      "Pricing depends on three criteria: base marble type (e.g., Makrana White vs. Belgian Black), density of stone petals per square foot, and the gemstone types selected (genuine Afghan Lapis Lazuli and Malachite versus Onyx or Agate).",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide worldwide shipping and on-site installation?",
    answer:
      "Yes. All pieces are packed in ISPM-15 export-certified shock-absorbent wooden crates with insurance. For complex palatial floors and stairs, master craftsmen from our Agra workshop travel to conduct on-site seamless installation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a custom architectural commission take?",
    answer:
      "A standard 36\" dining table takes 4 to 6 weeks. Complete palatial floor suites or full staircase assemblies typically require 8 to 14 weeks depending on the square footage and intricacy of the floral motifs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I enquire and share floorplans through WhatsApp?",
    answer:
      "Yes, our WhatsApp concierge operates directly with our senior lapidary director. You can instantly share PDF blueprints, site photos, or design references to receive stone estimates within 24 hours.",
